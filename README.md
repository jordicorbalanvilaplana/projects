# Personal Projects Repository  

Welcome to my personal projects repository! Here, I upload projects Iâ€™ve worked on related to data science and engineering. Each project represents a learning experience, showcasing my growth and skills in the field.  

## Projects  

### 1. **Routes i Monuments**  
   - **Description**: This project focuses on generating maps from GPS trajectories collected by hikers. Its goal is to identify optimal routes to the nearest medieval buildings in Catalonia and provide a clear visualization of the results.  
   - **Context**: Developed as part of the *Algorithmics and Programming 2* subject, which is part of the Bachelor's degree in Data Science and Engineering at the UPC.  
   - **Highlights**:  
     - Applied graph theory to compute the shortest routes among GPS locations.  
     - Designed and implemented clear result visualizations.  

Stay tuned for more projects as I continue my journey in data science and engineering!
