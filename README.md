# Personal Projects Repository  

Welcome to my personal projects repository! Here, I upload projects I've worked on related to data science and engineering. Each project represents a learning experience, showcasing my growth and skills in the field.  

## Projects  

### 1. [Routes i Monuments](https://github.com/jordicorbalanvilaplana/rutes_i_monuments)  
   - **Description**: This project focuses on generating maps from GPS trajectories collected by hikers. Its goal is to identify optimal routes to the nearest medieval buildings in Catalonia and provide a clear visualization of the results.  
   - **Context**: Developed as part of the *Algorithmics and Programming 2* subject, which is part of the Bachelor's degree in Data Science and Engineering at the UPC.  
   - **Highlights**:  
     - Applied graph theory to compute the shortest routes among GPS locations.  
     - Designed and implemented clear result visualizations.  

### 2. [Aviation Fleet Analytics Data Warehouse](https://github.com/onasiscart/BDA_proj1)  
   - **Description**: A complete ETL pipeline and analytical data warehouse for aviation fleet performance analysis. Processes flight operations data from PostgreSQL and loads it into a DuckDB data warehouse optimized for computing aircraft utilization and reliability KPIs.  
   - **Context**: Developed as part of the *Advanced Databases (BDA)* subject in the Bachelor's degree in Data Science and Engineering at the UPC. Collaboration with Ona Siscart Noguer.  
   - **Highlights**:  
     - Designed a star schema with 3 dimensions and 2 fact tables.  
     - Implemented ETL pipeline using pygrametl with data quality controls.  
     - Achieved 40-50x query speedup compared to source system queries.  
     - Computed industry-standard aviation KPIs (utilization, reliability, reporting rates).
